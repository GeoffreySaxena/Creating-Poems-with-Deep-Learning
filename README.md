# Creating Poems with Deep Learning

## In this Repository, I attempt to create poems by using Natural Language Processing Techniques. 

### I've compiled my own dataset for this project and you can find it as Poems.txt

### This is the poem I created: 

#### * Through enternity shall she love you 
#### * to be too away is true for the light is a man in the sun 
#### * in the darkness of a room i entered the purple city 
#### * i hear lake water lapping it look look much fun 
#### * to be like nickel for a terrible moment 
#### * early that his soft old son
